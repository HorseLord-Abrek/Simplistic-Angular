# Simplistic-Angular
## A Simple Angular Cheatsheet
<br>
*I find Angular docs confusing and not efficient enough while working on personal projects or trying to look up for a simple command or function. This repository was a personal cheatsheet yet after seeing more people struggling with navigating through official docs, I decided to make it public. Please feel free to contribute and make changes as necessary.*
